## Exercise 2
In this exercise, I am simulating data from a Poisson distribution and am plotting the corresponding log likelihood function with a vertical line at the maximum likelihood estimate. 

```{r}
lambda_true <- 4; n <- 20

y <- rpois(n=n, lambda=lambda_true)
lambda_hat <- mean(y)

log_likelihood <- function(lambda, y){
  n <- length(y)
  sum <- 0
  for(i in 1:n){
    sum <- sum + dpois(y[i], lambda=lambda, log=TRUE)
  }
  return(sum)
} 

lambda_grid <- seq(from=1, to=10, length.out=1000)

log_likelihood_values <- log_likelihood(lambda_grid, y=y)

plot(x=lambda_grid, y=log_likelihood_values, type="l", xlab=expression(lambda), ylab=expression(l(lambda)))

abline(v=lambda_hat, col="blue", lwd=2)
```

## Exercise 3
In this exercise, I am writing an R function `lprime` that takes an input $𝜆$ as well as the data $𝑌1,...,𝑌𝑛$ and returns the value of $𝑙′(𝜆)$.To check that your function works, evaluate it at the sample mean. 

```{r}
set.seed(1)
lambda_true <- 4; n<- 20
y <- rpois(n=n, lambda=lambda_true)

lprime <- function(lambda, y){
  n <- length (y)
  derivative <- sum ((y / lambda)-1)
  return(derivative)
  }

lambda_hat <- mean(y)
lambda_hat

checking_function <- lprime(lambda_hat, y)
checking_function
```
Yes, the results above are expected. I am  calculating the derivative of the log-likelihood function at the sample mean. This is the MLE for the Poisson parameter. The MLE evaluated at the sample mean should be 0. The derivative at `lambda_hat` is very close to 0, which is what we would expect because the computer can't calculated exactly.
